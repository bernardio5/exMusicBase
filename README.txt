exMusicBase is how I am teaching myself JavaScript library-writing and musical composition. And git, too. 

I play classical guitar. My goal for this library is to be able to generate
little works that I can play. I also wish to improve my sight-reading. 

I am not a trained musician. 

For my thinking on the design, look at designNotes.txt. 

For help on how to use the library, I intend to post a set of web pages in the 
“examples” directory. I also intend to put test functions into each class. 

Help yourself. Let me know if you find a use for it, OK? : )
